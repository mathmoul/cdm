Get copy of db connection on middleware ?? 

handle server json responses


in controllers : only handle req parsing datas && response | link to one or more models

in model : parse and modify datas | mailing | link to DB 

in DB : actions on DB (insert(new), update, delete, GetBy, GetAll)
=> don't use collection in model or controller. Use it only in DB
